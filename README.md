> I have tried to recreate events, locales and conversations from my memories of them. In order to maintain their anonymity in some instances I have changed the names of individuals and places, I may have changed some identifying characteristics and details such as physical properties, occupations and places of residence.

> This is a game that is dedicated to people who I have met and interacted during my lifetime in IIT Roorkee, This work is not meant to offend or Maine anyone's reputation as I am making this out of sheer respect to people around me, This will be my gift for them so they can remember me by. PS - I am sorry if this Offends you

> Just throwing it out here, I have made a private repo for my development and testing, Anyone who wants to contribute can contact me thru Email
